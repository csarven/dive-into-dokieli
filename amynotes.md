# Dive into dokieli: decentralised web publishing and interactions with linked data

## Abstract

In this paper we describe dokieli, a general purpose clientside tool for document authoring, editing and publication. Features are enabled progressively according to the needs and technical resources of the user. The editor is open source, built on web standards and documents are represented as linked data. This allows: decentralised storage and data ownership; live editing from an LDP-based personal data store; social interactions with documents (such as annotations and replies), and notifications thereof; fine-grained data embedding through RDFa; rich metadata such as provenance and licensing information; enhancements for academic research papers including live query/dataset stuff.

## Rambling

Linked data has so far been underutilised when ti comes to articles/prose and social (??) and user friendly editing stuff.. Things majority of people do on the web day to day.. Publishing longform content on the web, outside of specialised domains.

Normal people are publushing and sharing more textual data than ever. Blogging resurged in the form of status updates or journalistic-style article publishing through centralised websites (medium, that other one). Expressing oneself through self-publishing prose content on the web has becomre normalised, but organisation of this content is left to the silos that control it or search engine indexes. dokieli aims to provide an interface for generic web publishing needs which is usable by non-technical people, whilst looking to the future of privacy, data ownership and knowledge organisation.
